# Project Phase 3: Second Iteration - Final

## Need Finding
In online classes, teachers are suddenly faced with the challenge of how to continue their student's education. While this might seem a difficult task, there are several ways in which teachers can utilise the technology and resources already available to support online learning and ensure students still receive a quality education. 
There is no size to fit when it comes to learning (important). Different groups have different priorities and the resources that should be used are context-dependent. There are also special considerations to think about for students with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), and for students who might not have access to high-speed broadband.
However, teachers should take some comfort in the fact that there are hundreds of online resources to guide them as to how to teach online. I have rounded up some of the best here to help ease the transition from the classroom to the web.


## Design Alternatives

### Personas

- Ali is 28 years old. He is a High school science teacher. His goal is to teach his high school students about geologic diversity within their company and to make the course material more exciting through the visuals and exploration. His obstacles is that students often need some kind of visuals to understand or get excited about course material. 

- Hina is 39 years old. She is a Primary school teacher. She has a son son 12 years old and a daugter 17 years old. She encourages her child to use technology to help with their work. Her goal is to make learning fun and interactive, to use the latest technology when teaching, and to make her subjects simple and easy to understand as possilble. 

### Scenarios

- Ali is trying to educate his class well. He wants to use a technology that provides a framework for student discussion of the subject. So that he can easily solve students query that occurs during lecture and a technology that can save details such as, details about meeting (when and what time to hold a meeting), details about attendance because as a teacher he has to maintain records of sttudents. He searched and downloaded an application which would help him in maintaining his need and tasks. As he downloaded the app on his device it opens and loads the application when the app is started he interacted with the multiple options provided for the users for ease.

- Hina is trying to facilitate more productive ideas for her class. She wants the app to be engaging for children and educational so they are learning while having fun and wants the app to encourage the children to look around. She wants giver student an opportunity to work in group. They have their first project meeting and using ordinary mobile whiteboards and markers to write and draw on and a camera to photograph the process. Students document their work, such as brainstorming, sketching concepts, creation of a work, etc. She downloaded an app which has a user friendly environment, she interact with different features and found them useful.

## Using HCI concepts, the reason for key design features in this interface.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is an area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on developing computer technology and, in particular, interactions between humans (users) and computers. Initially, HCI was primarily concerned with computers, and now covers almost all forms of information technology design. It is the academic discipline that most of us think of as UI design.

I have worked and finalized my design on Teacher's activities. My designed application helps user in this aspect:
- Dicoverability: There are relevant options in my design which help user to perfom certain tasks.

- Simplicity: User can understand my application easily. It is simple design with options that can help user to achieve their tasks easily and help them, managing their daily needs.

- Affordance: It is used in the design as user can detect how certain options should work.

- Perceptibility: In manage student interface, it helps the user to find what meeting is placed against that date simply by clicking on that date. Detailed note for that meeting can be seen by the user and can be edited and he can also share this meeting with other users.

- Flexibility: I have provided different forms of views in which user and system exchange information. User are been provided meeting options that only user can view all the activities marked on the calender along with the current date and time mentioned, these activities date are marked different so that the user can easily have a look on all of their meetings.

- Ease and Comfort: My design is to encourage people to read with interest.
