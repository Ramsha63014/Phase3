# Project Phase 3: Second Iteration - Final

## Need Finding
In online classes, teachers are suddenly faced with the challenge of how to continue their student's education. While this might seem a difficult task, there are several ways in which teachers can utilise the technology and resources already available to support online learning and ensure students still receive a quality education. 
There is no size to fit when it comes to learning (important). Different groups have different priorities and the resources that should be used are context-dependent. There are also special considerations to think about for students with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), and for students who might not have access to high-speed broadband.
However, teachers should take some comfort in the fact that there are hundreds of online resources to guide them as to how to teach online. I have rounded up some of the best here to help ease the transition from the classroom to the web.


## Design Alternatives
By now you have studied all design principles. Using them and tools previously discussed 
- personas
- scenarios/storyboarding
- etc.
refine your design.


## Prototyping
Now you will move towards more mature prototypes for the final design you have selected.
- Wireframes (powerpoint or any other tool)
- physical prototypes 
- Window navigation transition hierarchy
Explain using HCI concepts, the reason for key design features in your interface.


## Evaluation
Get the prototypes evaluated by someone in your family or circle get detailed feedback.

## Submission Instructions

2) Make another .md file by the name Phase3 in the repository.
3) Add the elements of phase 3 as mentioned above in this md file.
4) Upload relevant material in a folder Phase3 in your repository.
